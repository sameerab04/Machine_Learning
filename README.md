| Homework | Overview |
| ------ | ------ |
| HW1 | This assignment steps through programming syntax with ggplot2 and introduces the formula interface with the lm() function. The grammar of graphics can help create meaningful visualizations which communicate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) findings. Visualizations will provide context to the model results, which might be opaque and difficult to interpret. In this assignment you will demonstrate basic syntax, go through a detailed EDA of a common data set, and then begin to work through the syntax of fitting a model.
